## CICD-JAVA-APPS-IN-AWS-CODEPIPELINE
### In this Project I larnt learnt how to build a CI/CD pipeline (AWS CodePipeline) to develop a java-based application and deploy it on an EC2 instance. 


###  I created the project  using CodeGuru resources and CodeArtifact repositories for maven-based package management for jar files
### Then I built a Pipeline comprising of Amazon CodeGuru automated code reviews and application profiling, AWS CodeArtifact (package management) and Amazon Corretto (Amazon's open jdk distribution). 
### I spurned the infrastructure using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), which enabled me to reproduce the environment when needed, in relatively fewer lines of code.
